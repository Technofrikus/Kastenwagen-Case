# Dissassemble if necessary

**Disassemble your existing Kastenwagen**, so only the top plate with switches in it and the PCB are still there. No standoffs, no bottom plate, no screws. No need to desolder anything.

The MCU *has to be* soldered **flat** on to the PCB (different PCB in the picture). Dont use any standoffs.

# Assembly

1. First **stick the gaskets on the Kastenwagen plate** like in the picture above, at the red lines. So around the screw holes. (the plate in the picture is missing the switch cutouts)
2. **On both sides** of the plate, please.
3. **Put the screws through the rubber feet**. Put the screw in from the smooth side of the feet. The other one has this rough texture from the print bed (like the top of the case itself). This is the side of the feet that goes into the keyboard.
    1. 3x long rubber part
    2. 3x short rubber part

4. **Put the case together** with the plate in the middle, screw in the screws with the feet attached.
    1. BE CAREFUL! **Just tighten the screws until the bottom of the case is smooth with top.** There is no “stop”, you dont feel the screws getting tighter. If you continue to tighten the screws they will damage the top part of the case which will be very visible!
        
        
5. **Cut the light guides to length**. Should be around **13,8mm.** Best use a knife, make a mark and break them, so both ends are flat and not squashed.

    1. Drill the three holes with a 1mm drill, so the light guide fits in. The holes are designed to be too small. Be careful while drilling to not make the holes bigger. Drill slowly.
    2. Rub them a bit in glue stick. You can also use other glue, but especially **super glue leaves visible marks on the print**, so be very careful or just use glue stick. 
    3. Push them in from the top. They have to go through the Plate onto the LED on the PCB to work properly. If you cant push them in completely, rotate them a bit so they find the hole in the Plate. 
6. **Flash this latest Firmware** on the board so you can use all the nice Features with VIAL, like Key Overrides, TapDance and Combos.
