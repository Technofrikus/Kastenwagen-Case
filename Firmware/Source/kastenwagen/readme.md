# Kastenwagen

TBD: update image

A description TBD: 
* Kastenwagen 1840 (with numpad)
* Kastenwagen 48 (with macro column)

Both models use the same firmware.  The keys corresponding to numpad keys 7, 4, and 1 are used as the macro column in the 48.
If using a rotary encoder in the top right, the operation of the rotational pins should be identical between versions.  However, the operation of the encoder when *pressed* will map to the key it replaces, which differs between the 48 and 1840.
