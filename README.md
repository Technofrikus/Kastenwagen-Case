# Kastenwagen-Case
Printable Case for the Kastenwagen by NoPunIn10Did
PCB and Plate available here: [Kastenwagen on Github](https://github.com/nopunin10did/kastenwagen)

Both versions for the big and small (without Numpad) Kastenwagen are available. __Kastenwagen1840__ and __Kastenwagen48__

This is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the Kastenwagen PCB and Plate. So it is not necessary to desolder anything. 

If you order the PCB etc yourself: you only need the switch-plate for this case, not the bottom plate. And no standoffs etc.

Please note: you HAVE to solder the MCU flat on the PCB, otherise the cutout in the case will not align with the USB.

It logo on the bottom is meant to be printed in one go with changing the filament, not glued in. There is no gap between these, so glueing will probably not work. Check [this instrucable](https://www.instructables.com/Poor-Mans-MMU-Multicolor-Printing-With-Single-Extr/) how to do this with only one Extruder.

## Print instructions
- Case, knob and logo can be printed in simple PLA
  - Normal amount of perimeters and infill is enough, more feels better and sturdier
  - Print the top upside down, the bottom normal side up
- The included printed feet are nice but you can also not print them and glue standard feet somewhere else on the case.
  - Print the feet with 60A TPU, so they are very soft and really help with slipping. Harder TPUs are still relatively slippy. I used Recreus
Filaflex 60A.
